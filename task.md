# Initialize Project with FastAPI Backend and React + Vite Frontend

"""
I want to create a web app that allows users to upload a video and a text prompt, which will then be analyzed frame by frame by OpenCV. Based on the prompt, the videoâ€™s content should be sent to GPT-4 for analysis. The goal is to understand interactions with UI elements in the video, describe how the UI works, and provide feedback to the user. Start with the following:

1. Set up a new project using FastAPI for the backend and React + Vite for the frontend.
2. Create a FastAPI route to handle video file uploads and text prompts.
3. Integrate a simple video file uploader in the React frontend, and ensure it connects to the backend.
4. Use OpenCV to extract frames from the video once uploaded, and set up the structure for sending these frames to the GPT-4 API.
5. Send GPT-4 API requests with a sample text prompt and display the results on the frontend.
6. Make this a modular setup, so I can expand use cases later. Please proceed with this plan in an iterative manner, and let me know how it's progressing step by step.
