To develop the app you described, we'll follow a phased approach, breaking it down into manageable steps for the front-end, back-end, and integration with AI and video processing tools. Here's a detailed development plan:

---

### **Development Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Project Setup**
1. **Set Up Frontend (React + Vite)**
   - Initialize a new project using Vite with React for the front-end.
   - Structure the components:
     - **Main Page**: A simple UI to upload videos and enter a prompt.
     - **Result Page**: A display area for the processed video information.
   
   **Tasks:**
   - Create a file upload component for video files.
   - Create a text input field for entering prompts.
   - Handle form submission to send video and prompt to the backend API.
   
2. **Set Up Backend (FastAPI)**
   - Initialize a FastAPI project.
   - Define the API routes:
     - **POST `/upload_video`**: Endpoint to receive video and prompt.
     - **GET `/result`**: Endpoint to retrieve processed results.
   
   **Tasks:**
   - Create a route for handling file uploads.
   - Implement request validation using Pydantic (for the prompt).
   - Set up an API response structure for sending results back.

#### **Phase 2: Video Processing and Frame Extraction**
1. **Frame Extraction**
   - Use **OpenCV** or **FFmpeg** to break the video into frames. The frequency of frame extraction can depend on video length (e.g., extract 1 frame per second or based on significant changes).
   
   **Tasks:**
   - Write a function to extract frames and store them temporarily.
   - Implement a way to handle large videos, possibly by limiting the number of frames processed.
   
2. **Object Detection or Text Extraction (if required)**
   - Use **YOLO** or **CLIP** to detect key UI elements.
   - If the UI involves text, use **Tesseract OCR** to extract text from each frame.
   
   **Tasks:**
   - Write functions to process frames for UI elements and text.
   - Create mechanisms to feed the extracted features into a structured format for LLM input.

#### **Phase 3: LLM (GPT-4) Integration**
1. **Prompt Construction**
   - For each frame (or selected frames), generate a structured input prompt that provides context and asks the LLM for insights.
   - Combine video frame descriptions into a coherent narrative for the LLM to process.

   **Tasks:**
   - Write a function to build the GPT-4 prompt using extracted video data.
   - Set up GPT-4 API integration for sending and receiving responses.

2. **Processing GPT-4 Response**
   - GPT-4 will return a text output that describes the video interaction based on the prompt.
   - Parse and format this response for display in the front-end.

   **Tasks:**
   - Implement error handling for API calls.
   - Structure the response data and prepare it for UI rendering.

#### **Phase 4: Frontend and Backend Integration**
1. **Link Frontend and Backend**
   - Connect the React front-end with the FastAPI backend via RESTful endpoints.
   - Ensure that video and prompt uploads trigger backend processing and return results in real-time (or asynchronously, depending on complexity).

   **Tasks:**
   - Handle form submission in React to POST video and prompt.
   - Display loading state while the backend processes the request.
   - Retrieve and display the response once available.

2. **Result Display**
   - Show the result of the LLM's video understanding in the front-end.
   - Create a user-friendly UI for the processed output, highlighting key insights from the video interaction.

#### **Phase 5: Additional Features & Optimization**
1. **Implement Use Case Expansions**
   - Allow for more complex use cases, like generating tutorials, reporting bugs, or documenting processes automatically.
   - Enable users to download or save LLM-generated descriptions for future use.

2. **Optimize Performance**
   - Optimize the video processing pipeline to handle larger videos efficiently.
   - Fine-tune the GPT-4 prompt building process to ensure accurate and useful outputs.

3. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Conduct rigorous testing on both front-end and back-end components.
   - Ensure compatibility across different video types and formats.
   - Add error handling for edge cases, like unsupported formats or timeouts in the LLM API call.

#### **Phase 6: Deployment**
1. **Deploy Frontend**: Deploy the React app using services like **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
2. **Deploy Backend**: Deploy the FastAPI backend using services like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean**.
3. **Monitor and Optimize**: Set up monitoring for API calls, video processing, and error rates to continuously optimize the app.
